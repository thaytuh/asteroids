The game will launch with a simple window, use **WASD** to move your ship and **SPACE** to shoot.
Shooting asteroids will break them apart into 2 smaller asteroids, unless you're shooting the smallest asteroid, which will just disappear.
Running your ship into an asteroid will end the game and print "Game over!" to the console.
